# Project 1: Retail Transaction Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a retail transaction dataset. The goal is to understand sales behavior, customer purchasing patterns, and overall transaction performance using Python.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains transaction-level information including:
- Transaction ID
- Customer ID
- Category and Item details
- Price per unit and quantity
- Total amount spent
- Payment method and location
- Transaction date
- Discount information

The dataset includes missing values in some columns, reflecting real-world data quality challenges.
- Source: Kaggle
- Rows: 12575
- Columns: 11
## Objectives
- Perform initial data inspection and cleaning
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Analyze overall sales performance
- Identify category-wise and time-based trends
- Visualize insights using clear and interpretable plots

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data type inspection and column standardization
- Handling of missing values without distorting data meaning
- Aggregation of sales data using groupby operations
- Monthly sales trend analysis across multiple years
- Visualization of trends with proper labeling and formatting

## Key Insights
- January records the highest sales, indicating strong start-of-year and stock-up purchasing behavior by customers.
- October shows the lowest sales, suggesting a temporary slowdown or postponed purchases.
- Sales remain largely stable across most months, reflecting consistent demand for essential products.
- A gradual increase from March to July highlights steady repeat purchases and regular consumption patterns
- Post-October recovery in November and December suggests festive-season influence and promotion-driven buying.
- Customer behavior shifts from bulk buying to routine replenishment after January, indicating predictable and need-based purchasing throughout the year.
  
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured exploratory analysis can extract meaningful insights from raw retail transaction data. The focus was on clarity, correctness, and ethical handling of missing data rather than aggressive assumptions.

The project establishes a strong foundation in data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization using Python.
